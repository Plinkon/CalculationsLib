{includes.h ERROR/S}
    1: if it says that the file can not be found, check in that directory for the file.
    If the file is there, then double and triple check that the included directory is the same.
    If this does not work, then I can't help you. Sorry.

{CAN NOT USE LIBRARY ERROR/S}
    1: if you can not use the library, check that your main.cpp or lib.cpp file is including the includes.h file.
    If this dosen't work, then make sure that all of the files in the calc folder are there.
    Make sure your calc folder look like this:

    calc:
        -advanced.cpp
        -basic_functions.cpp
        -NOTICE.txt

        -convert
            --converts.cpp
