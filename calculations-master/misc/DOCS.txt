PART 2: Advanced functions

    {EQUATIONS}
        all of the equaions speak for themselfes. If you want info on them, I might add info on them later. To use the advanced functions, you simple call each one by typing this: 
        advncd::function name();
        ECXEPT for the percentage function:
        advncd::percent(); You need to put 2 integers inside the parentheses. The first number is the number out of the max, the second is the maximun ammount.

    {CONVERSIONS}
        intToStr(); You need to put a integer inside of the parentheses. It will output the string of that integer.
        Experimental! If you want to use the variable that it creates, use the [ extern std::string istr ] command.

        strToInt(); You need to put a string inside of the parentheses. It will output the int of that string.
        Experimental! If you want to use the variable that it creates, use the [ extern int numStr ] command.

        strToDbl(); You need to put a string inside of the parentheses. It will output the double of that string.
        Experimental! If you want to use the variable that it creates, use the [ extern double numDouble ] command.

        dblToStr(); You need to put a double inside of the parentheses. It will output the string of that double.
        Experimental! If you want to use the variable that it creates, use the [ extern std::string strTd ] command.

        chrToInt(); You need to put a char inside of the parentheses. It will output the int of that char.
        Experimental! If you want to use the variable that it creates, use the [ extern int my_int ] command.

        intToChr(); You need to put a integer inside of the parentheses. It will output the char of that integer.
        Experimental! If you want to use the variable that it creates, use the [ extern char my_char ] command.



PART 3: Other / Miscellaneous

    {Q/A}
        Q: "I have an error. How do I fix it?"
        A: "Go to the misc folder, open the ERRORS.txt file. If you still can't fix your error, report it to github."

        Q: "This thing is not working! (or) There is a bug in the code! You suck at coding!"
        A: "I have not tested all of the functions yet. If some do not work, report it and I will fix it. (maybe)"

        Q: "Are you ever going to update this?"
        A: "If I can find things to add, I will definetly update this and add more functions and features."
