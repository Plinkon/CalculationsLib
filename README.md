# CalculationsLib
## *DESCRIPTION*
This is a ***solo*** C++ library for doing *simple* and *complex* math problems. Not only can this library do calculations super easily, it can also *convert* variables!
## *HOW-TO USE*
In order to use this library, click the green "code" button and download as a Zip file. Extract the file and open the README.txt file.
## *ABOUT*
I was very bored, so I decided, *"Why not make a library?"* I learned throughout the creation process that making libraries is difficult. I also noticed that a lot of libraries don't document their code well. I think that is not good, so I made what I would call "good documentation".
